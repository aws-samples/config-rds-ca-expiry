## APG Pattern - Detect RDS instances with expiring CA certificates

TODO: Update URLs!

This sample code is part of an APG Pattern titled [Detect RDS instances with expiring CA certificates
](https://aws.amazon.com/).

The [config-rds-ca-expiry](config-rds-ca-expiry.yaml) CloudFormation template deploys an AWS Config
rule, AWS Lambda function, and necessary permissions to detect AWS RDS instances that use a CA certificate that is soon to expiry.

For more information, please review the [APG Pattern](https://aws.amazon.com/).
